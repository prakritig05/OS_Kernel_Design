Project Custom Kernel with GRUB Bootloader

Description
This project contains two custom kernels — one barebones and one meaty skeleton — that can be booted using GRUB from ISO images. The kernels are designed for a basic boot process that prints a message to the screen, and the ISOs were created using GRUB for a multiboot-compatible system.
